This is an intelligent, privacy-focused document question-answering system built entirely to run locally. Users can upload PDF documents, and the app automatically processes and indexes them using state-of-the-art semantic embeddings and a vector database. With a simple chat interface, users can ask questions about their uploaded files and receive accurate, context-aware answers â€” all without sending data to the cloud. The backend is powered by Django for secure authentication and user management, while LangChain, Hugging Face, ChromaDB, and Ollama work together to create a fast and reliable local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
